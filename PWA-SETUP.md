## üìã Browser Support

| Browser | Desktop Install | Mobile Install | Offline Support |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Chrome  | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ              |
| Edge    | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ              |
| Firefox | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ              |

## üé® Customization

The PWA appearance can be customized by modifying:

- **App Name**: Update `name` and `short_name` in the manifest configuration

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Registration
‚úÖ **Automatic Registration**: The app uses automatic service worker registration that only activates in production builds. No manual registration needed!

### Installation Prompt Not Showing
- Ensure you're using the **built version** (`yarn build` then `yarn preview`)
- Use HTTPS (or localhost for development)
- Check that all required PWA criteria are met
- Clear browser cache and try again

### App Not Working Offline
- Verify you're testing the **built version** (not dev mode)
- Check browser dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
- Ensure the service worker is active and running
- Check the Network tab for cached resources

### Icons Not Displaying
- Verify icon files exist in the `public/` directory
- Check icon sizes match the manifest configuration
- Clear app cache and reinstall

### Development vs Production
- **Development mode** (`yarn dev`): PWA features are disabled, debug panel shows in bottom-left
- **Production mode** (`yarn build` + `yarn preview`): Full PWA functionality
